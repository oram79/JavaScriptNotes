aysnc Functions : during our react disccusions!

REACT:
    A  Front-end JS library to creat intutitive, responsive UIs.
    HTML, CSS , JavScript - front end technologies! (already disccused)

    React actually works on a concept of "compontents", the components remian the
    same and thier data keep on changing....

    SPA: Single Page Application! (index.html is the only page that is loaded
    from server... rest all data is update inside the components)

MEAN/MERN:
    MongoDB(Persistance storage), ExpressJS (Used to setup the servers), AnglerJS
    (UI library/frameowork that can be used to make UIs), NodeJS (runtime 
    enviroment) (MEAN)
    MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS (MERN)

REACT is based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

WHY REACT: UI becomes difficult to manage with Vanila JavaScript
