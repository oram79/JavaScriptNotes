aysnc Functions : during our react disccusions!

REACT:
    A  Front-end JS library to creat intutitive, responsive UIs.
    HTML, CSS , JavScript - front end technologies! (already disccused)

    React actually works on a concept of "compontents", the components remian the
    same and thier data keep on changing....

    SPA: Single Page Application! (index.html is the only page that is loaded
    from server... rest all data is update inside the components)

MEAN/MERN:
    MongoDB(Persistance storage), ExpressJS (Used to setup the servers), AnglerJS
    (UI library/frameowork that can be used to make UIs), NodeJS (runtime 
    enviroment) (MEAN)
    MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS (MERN)

REACT is based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

WHY REACT: UI becomes difficult to manage with Vanila JavaScript


First Application:

node_modules is the biggest folder in our Application. so much so, that we exclude
it when pushing the contents to the github....

NEVER SEND YOUR NODE_MODULES FOLDER WHILE SENDING YOUR PROJECTS TO SOMEONE....

node_modules consists of all libraries/files needed to run
react Application.... NEVER SEND....

July 3,2024:

package.json "npm install" actually looks package.json and 
installs or creates the folder node_modules for all required
files that are mentioned in package.json

ALWAYS SEND YOUR PACKAGE.JSON TO ME WHILE SENDING YOUR
PROJETCS,, NEVER SEND NODE_MODULES...

in public folder we have "index.html", this is a Single page
that runs when react app runs....

in src folder we have "index.html" that somehow accesses the
index.html's div with root id and renders there "<App/>"
component.

App component is the main component that runs when we run our react
application.... 

All component 'sytax is like functions ... the diffrence is that the component
actually returns "JSX"

function App(){

    return "JSX"
}

JSX ... is a combination of HTML, CSS and JS.
{ } JavaScript expression box where we write any javascript!

Every component returns "JSX" that is boiled down to HTML
when it goes to index.html
