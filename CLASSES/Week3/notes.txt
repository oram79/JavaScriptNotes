let list=[0,"1","name",true];
Array properties and methods:

arr.length - length of the array
arr.push() to insert one element at the end of an Array

arr.unshift() Inserts at the beginning
arr.shift() removed from the beginning

arr.join("x"); returns a string created by joining(concatenating) all elements in the array with the given delimiter - split() is opposite of join

Methods for iterating accross the elements in an array:
    for loop:
    forEach Method:
