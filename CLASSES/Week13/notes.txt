Testing React Components:

Testing:
    - build software that works
    - we write tests that check that
    - to check whether our software works as expected

Manual vs automated testing:

1. Manual testing 
- opens the website, interacts with in all possible way
to ensure everything is working

2. automated testing
- programs that automate the task of testing the software
- aditional effort is required, but once done it can be used
for mulitple softwares

Jest (JavaScript testing framework) & RTL (React Testing Library)

JEST:
- is a test runnner that runs the test, determines where 
tests are passed or failed and reports back to the user

RTL: 
- testing utility provides the "virtual DOM" for testing react Components
- virtual DOM can be used to interact and verify the behaviour of a react Component

TYPES OF TESTS:
1. unit tests
2. integration tests
3. end to end tests (e2e)

UNIT TESTS 
- tessting of indiviual block of an application. each unit is tested in
isolation, independent of other units. run in a short amount of time and mak
it easy to pinpoint failues, easdier to write and maintain
