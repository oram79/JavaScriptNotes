 Relative Path and absolute path????

Three ways to run JavaScript!
    1. Using Terminal - we go into the folder where file exists and then run it by using command "node filename.js".

    2. Using browser - attach the script by using <script> element and see the output in the console of the browser..

    3. REPL: Read Evaluate Process Loop:
        i) Browser REPL
        ii) Terminal REPL


Introduction to JavaScript!
    Interpreted JIT(Just in compilation), light-weight meant to be embedded in host environments for example web browsers

    JavaScript looks similar to C, C++. C language is generally reffered as mother or modern programming languages..Though it seems similar to C, but it is quite different from C in philosophy..

    JavaScript (mid 90s) at that time JS was actually ONLY for client side scripts...
                to the Server Side scripts
                to the console based applications...
                NODE JS :)


            Client  ------> Server
            
            Static Website:
            When clients asks for a website and server sends back the copy of that website (and do not do any processing of its own...). Clients receives and executes it( scripts are client side scripts).
            shiwng same contents to every user!


            Dynamic Website:
            When clients asks fora website, the server runs some script that may or may not interact with a database or with some sensors etc and produces a result after running the script(server side script) and sends back the result[client side scripts] to the client.
            showing different contents to every user!


JavaScript Syntax:

1. JavaScript is case sensitive: x, X treated different!
    customerName, CustomerName

2. camelCase naming in JavaScript! PascalCase, snake_case, kebab-case 

3. Semi colons are optional are optional. Semi colon is called "Statement Terminator" ;
    Though it is optional in JS, but it is highly recommended
4. Comments in JS:
    // this is called single Comments
    /* 
    this multiline ocmment

    */

    */ Name: Assignment: Date: May 7,2024 */
    <!-- comments --> HTML Comment

5. Statements in JS: A prgoram is series of statments in JS. A statement is a single-line of instructuion made up of objects,expressions,variables and events etc etc..

6. Block Statement: 
    {

    }

    if(x>0)
    {

    }else{

    }

7. Functions in JS:
    Primary building block of JS programs. Different from Python!

8. Variables in JS:
    var
    let 
    const
